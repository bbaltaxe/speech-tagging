# Speech Tagging 
This repo contains code for creating a dataset of spoken utterances. 

Splice.py splits conversational audio files on silence. Run splice.py -h for more info. 

### For Jeanette- 
1. Run script to separate sounds
2. Create a folder for each spoke utterance and add (ex. titi tata ... one two ... )
3. Within those - Separate kids vs adults
4. Upload to drive or private git?
